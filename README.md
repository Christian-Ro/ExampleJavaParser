# ExampleJavaParser

Basic parser to parse a text file with information about customers, orders, and products.
It ouputs 3 files in different formats depending on the content.

***The three output files are***
-customers.xml
-orders.json
-products.csv

The sample text file is in:
> /src/test-file.txt


# TODO
-Need to refactor into a more object oriented approach.
